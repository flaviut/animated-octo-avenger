Prototype of pattern matching on trees.

Interesting, but the usefulness is limited. There easier to reason about methods
of doing the same thing, perhaps even with better performance characteristics.

One such way might be the Nanopass Framework [Sarkar2005] with pass fusion, but more research is
necessary wrt the correctness of such fusion (benign side effects?).
