Sort prototype with pattern matching on a tree.

Interesting, but the usefulness is limited. There easier to reason about methods
of doing the same thing, perhaps even with better performance characteristics.

One such way might be the Nanopass Framework [Sarkar2005] with pass fusion, but more research is
necessary wrt the correctness of such fusion (benign side effects?).
